## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed:

- **AWS CLI** ([Install Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html))
- **Terraform >= 1.5** ([Install Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads))
- **kubectl** ([Install Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)) - for managing your cluster

### Deploy Your Infrastructure

```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/idanvn/startup-production-stack
cd startup-production-stack

# 2. Configure AWS credentials
aws configure

# 3. Setup infrastructure (creates terraform.tfvars)
./scripts/setup.sh

# 4. Deploy to AWS (15-20 minutes)
./scripts/deploy.sh

# 5. Configure kubectl for your new cluster
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-west-2 --name your-cluster-name
```

That's it! Your production infrastructure is ready. üéâ

### Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check your cluster
kubectl get nodes

# Deploy a test application
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer

# Get the load balancer URL
kubectl get service nginx
```

## Cost Breakdown

### Development Environment (~$150/month)
- **EKS Cluster**: $72/month (control plane)
- **EC2 Instances**: $45/month (2 √ó t3.medium)
- **RDS Database**: $13/month (db.t3.micro)
- **ElastiCache**: $11/month (cache.t3.micro)
- **Networking**: $25/month (NAT Gateway, data transfer)

### Production Environment (~$500/month)
- **EKS Cluster**: $72/month (control plane)
- **EC2 Instances**: $220/month (5 √ó t3.large)
- **RDS Database**: $200/month (db.r5.large + read replica)
- **ElastiCache**: $115/month (cache.r6g.large cluster)
- **Networking**: $45/month (NAT Gateway, data transfer)

üí° **Cost Optimization**: See our [Cost Optimization Guide](docs/cost-optimization.md) to reduce costs by up to 70%!

## Customization

eks_node_instance_types = ["t3.large", "t3.xlarge"]
rds_instance_class     = "db.r5.large"
redis_node_type        = "cache.r6g.large"

# Network Configuration
vpc_cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
availability_zones = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b", "us-west-2c"]
```
